   - Generate an App Password for the website
   - Update the `.env.local` file with the real App Password

2. **Testing in Production**
   - Deploy the application to Vercel or another hosting platform
   - Add the environment variables to the hosting platform
   - Test the forms in the production environment

3. **Optional Enhancements**
   - Add CAPTCHA to prevent spam submissions
   - Implement auto-responders for form submissions
   - Create different email templates for different form types
   - Add form submission tracking or analytics

## How to Test the Implementation

1. **Local Testing**
   - Start the Next.js development server: `npm run dev`
   - Open the application in a browser
   - Fill out and submit one of the forms
   - Check the console for the email content (if no Gmail credentials are configured)
   - Use the test script: `node test-api.js`
   - Use the standalone test form: open `test-form.html` in a browser

2. **Production Testing**
   - After deploying and configuring Gmail credentials, submit a test form
   - Check the email inbox for the received message
   - Verify that all form fields are correctly included in the email

## Conclusion

The contact form system is now fully implemented and ready for use. Once you set up your Gmail App Password and add it to the environment variables, the forms will start sending real emails to info@fuelfoods.store.

The implementation follows best practices for security, error handling, and user experience. The forms provide immediate feedback to users and gracefully handle any errors that may occur during submission.
