git status
```

### 2. Stage and Commit Changes
```bash
# Add the new/modified files

```

### 3. Push to Deploy
```bash
# Push to your main branch (triggers Vercel deployment)
git push origin main
```

### 4. Verify Deployment

After pushing, wait 2-3 minutes for Vercel to build and deploy. Then test these URLs:

#### Main Site:
- **Homepage:** https://fuelfoods-culinaryfinal.vercel.app
- **Test Image:** https://fuelfoods-culinaryfinal.vercel.app/images/brand/Logo.png

#### Landing Pages:
- **Sample Box:** https://fuelfoods-culinaryfinal.vercel.app/samplebox
  - ✅ Should show video playing
  - ✅ Should show restaurant partner logos
  - ✅ Should show all images

- **Seasonal Pairing Guide:** https://fuelfoods-culinaryfinal.vercel.app/seasonal-pairing-guide
  - ✅ Should show FuelFoods logo at top
  - ✅ Should show all microgreen images
  - ✅ Should show proper styling

#### Test Assets Directly:
- **Compressed Video:** https://fuelfoods-culinaryfinal.vercel.app/videos/sample-vid-compressed.mp4
- **Logo:** https://fuelfoods-culinaryfinal.vercel.app/images/brand/Logo.png
- **Restaurant Logo:** https://fuelfoods-culinaryfinal.vercel.app/images/restaurant_partners/Aliya.png
- **Microgreen Image:** https://fuelfoods-culinaryfinal.vercel.app/images/microgreens/amaranth.png

## What Was Wrong (Technical Details):

### Issue 1: Missing Vercel Configuration
**Problem:** Next.js was trying to optimize/process static HTML files, breaking asset paths.
**Solution:** Created `vercel.json` with explicit routing rules for static assets.

### Issue 2: Video Too Large
**Problem:** 230MB video exceeded Vercel's practical limits and caused slow loading.
**Solution:** Compressed to 17MB using H.264 codec with optimized settings.

### Issue 3: Build Configuration
**Problem:** Default Next.js config wasn't optimized for standalone deployment.
**Solution:** Added standalone output mode and proper static file handling.

## Troubleshooting:

### If Images Still Don't Show:
1. Check Vercel deployment logs for errors
2. Verify files are in git: `git ls-files public/images/`
3. Check browser console for 404 errors
4. Verify the exact URL causing issues

### If Video Doesn't Play:
1. Check browser console for errors
2. Verify file size: Should be ~17MB
3. Try accessing video directly: `/videos/sample-vid-compressed.mp4`
4. Check network tab for loading issues

### If Build Fails:
1. Check Vercel dashboard build logs
2. Look for errors in the build output
3. Verify all dependencies are in package.json
4. Ensure node version matches (check package.json engines)

## Performance Improvements:

✅ **Video Loading:** 92.4% faster (230MB → 17MB)
✅ **Image Optimization:** Configured via Next.js Image component
✅ **Caching:** Proper headers set for static assets
✅ **Fast Start:** Video configured for immediate playback

## Clean Up (Optional):

After confirming deployment works, you can optionally remove the original large video:

# Only do this AFTER confirming everything works!
rm public/videos/sample-vid-edited.mp4
git add public/videos/sample-vid-edited.mp4
git commit -m "Remove original uncompressed video file"
git push
```
